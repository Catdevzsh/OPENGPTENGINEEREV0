Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/FlamesCo/OPENGPTENGINEEREV0.git
cd OPENGPTENGINEEREV0
Usage
Running the Engine
To use the engine, you have two main scripts available:

run.sh: For executing a single instance or task.
run_continuous.sh: For running the engine in a continuous mode, suitable for long-term processes or services.
Single Execution
Execute the run.sh script to start the engine for a one-time operation:

bash
Copy code
./run.sh
This script will initialize the engine, perform the task defined within, and then conclude its execution.

Continuous Execution
For continuous operation, use the run_continuous.sh script:

bash
Copy code
./run_continuous.sh
